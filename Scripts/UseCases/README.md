# Content

This folder contains the **templates for the snippet and constraint functions scripts**. Both templates include the bare minimum of a what a snippet or constraint should be made of. Simply copy them and alter the content to easily create new ones.

**Please do not change the templates in this folder, as they should be reusable and already contain everything to make them work in the TPI framework.**
